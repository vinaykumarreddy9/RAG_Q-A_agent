Most new renewables are solar, followed by wind then hydro then bioenergy.[195] Investment in renewables, especially solar, tends to be more effective in creating jobs than coal, gas or oil.[196][197] Worldwide, renewables employ about 12 million people as of 2020, with solar PV being the technology employing the most at almost 4 million.[198] However, as of February 2024, the world's supply of workforce for solar energy is lagging greatly behind demand as universities worldwide still produce more workforce for fossil fuels than for renewable energy industries.[199]

In 2021, China accounted for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity.[200]

There are 3,146 gigawatts installed in 135 countries, while 156 countries have laws regulating the renewable energy sector.[7][201]

Globally in 2020 there are over 10 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer.[202] The clean energy sectors added about 4.7 million jobs globally between 2019 and 2022, totaling 35 million jobs by 2022.[203]: 5 

Usage by sector or application
Some studies say that a global transition to 100% renewable energy across all sectors – power, heat, transport and industry – is feasible and economically viable.[204][205][206]

One of the efforts to decarbonize transportation is the increased use of electric vehicles (EVs).[207] Despite that and the use of biofuels, such as biojet, less than 4% of transport energy is from renewables.[208] Occasionally hydrogen fuel cells are used for heavy transport.[209] Meanwhile, in the future electrofuels may also play a greater role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and maritime shipping.[210]

Solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180 GWth). Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings[211] and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China. Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households.

Heat pumps provide both heating and cooling, and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing priority.[212] Renewable thermal energy is also growing rapidly.[213] About 10% of heating and cooling energy is from renewables.
